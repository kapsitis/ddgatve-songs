<lyrics>
# Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;\\
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:\\
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,\\
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
# Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day,\\
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away,\\
Change and decay in all around I see;\\
O thou who changest not, abide with me.
# I need thy presence ev'ry passing hour;\\
What but thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?\\
Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?\\
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.
# I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;\\
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\\
Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?\\
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.
